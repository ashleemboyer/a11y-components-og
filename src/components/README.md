# Components

## How to Add a Component

1. Add a new directory with the component's name to `src/components/`. Make sure it uses proper capitalization, like `<Component>` and `<MyComponent>`.
2. Add a `<Component>.css`, `<Component>.js`, `README.md`, and `index.js` file to the directory from 1.
3. Update [the list below](#listofcomponents) with the name of the component and a link to its directory.
4. When the component is ready for use (AKA its `index.js` file is exporting the component), update the [`index.js` file in this directory](./index.js) to properly export the component.

## List of Components
